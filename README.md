## **Declaration of human rights**

## HOW TO ARCHIVE HUMAN'S RIGHTS / CHILDREN'S RIGHTS FOR AND IN AN ALWAYS CHANGING GLOBAL WORLD?

### We have to take into consideration that the idea of children's rights only comes from the 19th and 20th century. this idea is somewhat 100 years old. before that children were treated as young adolescent. so how can we as a society make sure that these children will keep their rights and that these rights remain in an ever changing global world? how can we make sure that children all around the world have access to the idea of their rights and that they will be treated in a fair way? And how can we make sure that education will be accessible throughout the future ?

DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 

# Molo Songololo 1st Magazine: ARTIFACT

![IMD%20CODING%20ARCHIVE%20PROJECT/1-1.jpg](IMD%20CODING%20ARCHIVE%20PROJECT/1-1.jpg)

How i found the artifact? 

I was researching into the archive within the section of human rights when I came across these two posters regarding childrens rights from South africa. Then I came across the Organization Molo Songololo and then I found the Magazine.

# FEEDBACK:

FEEDBACK:

Stick to the idea of the declaration from french revolution as the first starting point because then it all connects with each other. Think of how much is law and how much is already going into movement so make a stop there and have a clear idea of what is established within law and education and not yet movements. 

mapping on how and where and when things happened around the world regarding childrens rights and how can I create a timeline maybe to show that within certain areas and cultures and contexts around the world. So find mapping points of happenings.  

Maybe the poster i chose as the artifact is not the most exciting thing, maybe I can choose the collection of the magazine of molo songololo and use these issues as an artifact and transcode from there taking different things into consideration like: language, visual sketches and written text. 

do more research into the magazine molo songololo:

on how they communicated within these times since it was just after apartheid

how much it was based in south africa of the magazine and how free they were?

research more into 80/90 (to what degree is the idea of the childrens rights coming from locals and black children and how much is from outside and the western perspective on this?)

FEEDBACK 

use the magazine and the format to create visuals: 

- comics - personas to archive / memorize different rights

My research question and my topic is still quite broad: 

- narrow it down to maybe one part of the world or one timeframe of the world

Instead of working only with visuals I could use words: 

- work with words and the meaning of words and how important is: for example buold a  tool that analyzes the most frequent words and the importance in history and the meaning

Endresult imd and coding combined: 

it is about how to archive my artrifact for the world and what I think is an important insight in this. So in the end in the [readme.md](http://readme.md) will be the  research, the experimentation, and the documentation on how to use the transcoding tool that I created 

TOOLS: 

- if i for example create a google maps map api then i will also explain how to use this tool and how to create it
- openstreetmaps
- interactive maps
- google maps api
- also unity
- interactive 3d map to explore
- tool that analyzes the most frequent words and the importance

Transcoding: 

the language of information 

encoding systems like from audio to text because brain processes it in a different way ....

like working with language as material 

or a photo : in how many ways can you reproduce this photo? 

maybe for me like in how many ways can I reproduce these basic written words of human rights? reproduce the language? 

what is the connection between printed media and online media for human rights? 

what is the relation with these printed matters to turn it into a short video clip for example? like specifically for children, how  would a video clip for children look like? 

so transcoding is also on what do we see and how do we perceive it and how do we understand it/ how does our brain understand it ? 

### 2 MAIN FACTORS FOR STARTING POINTS OF TRANSCODING:

### -MOLO SONOGLOLO MAGAZINE AS MATERIAL

### -TEXT/LANGUAGE AS MATERIAL ?

### from these two materials I have to find a way to start with ideas of how to transcode it in new and other media :

- printed matter
- interactive mapping / 3d

Feedback IMD:

TRANSCODINGS:

- there might be some transcodings which have a longer development and sometimes can be something vey quick and will only take 10 min
- some of these sketches can be quick and wild
- In the end I could have like 3 outcomes and that are still somehow connected
- maybe in unity can be more connected with the concept of the game and the visual of the magazine
- how can these things and these transcodings be different from each other and take the freedom to decide what i want to do
- for all my existing transcoding ideas he sees 3 different things right now

TEXT: 

when you work a lot with text like is there a tool to work with this so the digital tool can be a database, like is there a word that you create and this can create certain layers and then you start thinking what does it mean as a format in transcoding so it can become more like an encyclopedia

VISUAL:

molo songololo: I can also work with very quick ways and transcode maybe also only image for example of the magazine. maybe i can work with something thatâ€™s with visual language so only images (like the experiment i already started) what could be the next process in for example digitizing the images could these be translated in 3d objects for example? or something else?

what could be an interesting step with these images > like the link he sent and what could be the idea behind that just like a process

visual exercise and what kind of tools do i want to work with

When working with the magazine as the transcoding artifact it might sometimes it only be one aspect of the magazine, like I can address different things

maybe i want to make a collection of all the drawings out of context

Maybe I have new and different research questions like: how can we archive the visual language in a longer term way of the magazine

step 1 > what is the material (what happens here and what is the reflection on this step)

step 2 > how to project these into different digital objects like jpg.

step 3 > transcode it into 3d objects for example

FEEDBACK CODING: 

- yes continue with non linear timeline for the game but start small with unity, like start with the first sketches of islands and landscape and then turn this into some interactivity with unity
- for the visual sketches, maybe i turn them into bitmaps or other visual language to use them also in my game:

[Dad Turns His 6-Year-Old Son's Drawings Into Reality And The Results Are Both Creepy And Hilarious (31 Pics)](https://www.boredpanda.com/kid-drawings-things-i-have-drawn-dom/)

- for the text transcoding i can use the tool he sent and then transcode it with js and its already a transcoding for coding and imd:

[naptha/tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/blob/master/docs/examples.md)

[Tesseract.js | Pure Javascript OCR for 100 Languages!](https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/)

[JavaScript OCR Using Tesseract.js | Interesting JS Library Series | Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHTasYqs4Tw)

also research into concrete poetry (the book) for typo references. 

for now 3 transcodings: 

non linear map (long term transcoding)

language as material/word - work with tresseract.js

visual output of molo songololo

 

TO DO UNTIL 06. APRIL: 

- [ ]  first 2 islands for my game with interactivity in unity
- [ ]  try out this coding tool for transcoding my text
