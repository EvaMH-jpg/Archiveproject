## HOW TO ARCHIVE CHILDREN'S RIGHTS FOR AND IN AN ALWAYS CHANGING GLOBAL WORLD?

First starting point: 

The declaration of childrens rights - poster

### We have to take into consideration that the idea of childrens rights only comes from the 19th and 20th century. this idea is somewhat 100 years old. before that children were treated as young adolescent. so how can we as a society make sure that these children will keep their rights and that these rights remain in an everchanging global wolrd? how can we make sure that children all around the world have access to the idea of their rights and that they will be treated in a fair way? And how can we make sure that education will be accessible throughout the future ?

How i found the artifact? 

I was researching into the archive within the section of human rights when I came across these two posters regarding childrens rights from South africa. 

Tell us **ABOUT** this artefact: what current information is encoded in the IISG Archive, how, what formats?

[Untitled](IMD%20CODING%20ARCHIVE%20PROJECT/Untitled%20Database.csv)

Tell us something about the social history or context of the artefact. Something that isn’t contained in the current IISG Record. How did you collect & store this research? Link; Download; In a Google Doc?

How would you preserve a cultural artefact, if the IISG could no longer exist? Think about:

→ **MEDIA** (Material) Stone; Paper; Hard-drive; Network; etc

→ **FORMAT** (Encoding) Original (physical;) Facsimile (Photo; Print-out; JPG; MP3; MOV; etc) Interpretative or Representative?

→ **METHODOLOGY** (Transcoding) What tools are required for transcoding the information? What tools are needed for reading the information? Language? Symbology?

→ **PRESERVATION** (Lifespan) What is the shelf-life of this transcoded media?

FEEDBACK:

Stick to the idea of the declaration from french revolution as the first starting point because then it all connects with each other. Think of how much is law and how much is already going into movement so make a stop there and have a clear idea of what is established within law and education and not yet movements. 

mapping on how and where and when things happened around the world regarding childrens rights and how can I create a timeline maybe to show that within certain areas and cultures and contexts around the world. So find mapping points of happenings.  

Maybe the poster i chose as the artifact is not the most exciting thing, maybe I can choose the collection of the magazine of molo songololo and use these issues as an artifact and transcode from there taking different things into consideration like: language, visual sketches and written text. 

do more research into the magazine molo songololo:

on how they communicated within these times since it was just after apartheid

how much it was based in south africa of the magazine and how free they were?

research more into 80/90 (to what degree is the idea of the childrens rights coming from locals and black children and how much is from outside and the western perspective on this?)

## Ideas and ways of how to transcode for my research question: "How to archive human rights/childrens rights in an always changing globalized world?

title of my project: crossroads maybe?????? 

- text- how to transcode language and pdf versions of something ?
- imagery
- timeline like creating different events on how and when something around the world in connection with human rights happened
- non linear timeline transcoding the content of these things
- like paintings or drawings (paintings are for sure something which stays in history and gains value over time instead of increasing. maybe there is a way how children would archive and cimmunicate these rights)
- mapping points like create an interactive map with coding which you can find out about the happenings around the world ? as a way of transcoding these ideas

Fine example of Arnold Colom's rare double hemisphere map of the World, which appeared in his *Zee-Atlas*.

The map provides a fine depiction of the World. California is shown as an island, with a large landmass running due east and west to the north entitled Nova Albion, one of the only maps to provide this designation to this landmass (along with the map of his father Jacob Colom, published in 1650).

- a game like jenga or mancala - is something commonly known and can be passed on from generation to generation

    Transcoding: 

    the language of information 

    encoding systems like from audio to text because brain processes it in a different way ....

    like working with language as material 

    or a photo : in how many ways can you reproduce this photo? 

    maybe for me like in how many ways can I reproduce these basic written words of human rights? reproduce the language? 

    what is the connection between printed media and online media for human rights? 

    what is the relation with these printed matters to turn it into a short video clip for example? like specifically for children, how  would a video clip for children look like? 

    so transcoding is also on what do we see and how do we perceive it and how do we understand it/ how does our brain understand it ? 

    ### 2 MAIN FACTORS FOR STARTING POINTS OF TRANSCODING:

    ### MOLO SONOGLOLO MAGAZINE AS MATERIAL

    ### TEXT/LANGUAGE AS MATERIAL

    ### 

    ### from these two materials I have to find a way to start with ideas of how to transcode it in new and other media :

    ### 

    ### printed matter

    ### interactive mapping / 3d
